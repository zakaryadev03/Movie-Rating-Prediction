[Report](https://github.com/zakaryadev03/Movie-Rating-Prediction/raw/main/Movies_Ratings_Prediction.pdf)

This project implements a **scalable movie recommendation system** using the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), leveraging AWS cloud services (S3, Glue, Athena, QuickSight) for automated data ingestion, preprocessing, and visualization. The system trains a **collaborative filtering model** (SVD) with an RMSE of **0.89**, deployed via a CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) for weekly retraining. Key features include:  
- **66% data reduction** through optimized Parquet storage.  
- Dynamic dashboards for EDA (genre trends, top-rated films).  
- Dockerized API endpoint for real-time predictions.  

Ideal for learning **MLOps, cloud automation, and recommender systems**, this project demonstrates end-to-end workflows from raw data to production-ready inference. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
